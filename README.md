# LavaHeist-Pygame
This was a project that my partner and I did for Computer Science. The graphics were created by my partner whilst the code was primarly written by me.

It is a game written in Python. Your objective is to collect as many gems as possible before time runs out. 
The map is procedurally generated each playthrough and will be different except for the spawn area. 
There is sound in the game.

See the system requirements and run instruction file for instructions to run.
Please use the batch files to run the game as their were some issues getting it to run without the batch file.
If the .run batchfile hangs and doesn't start the game press enter a couple of times on the window to see if that fixes it.
All assets must be kept in the same folder as they are now.

If there are issues please create an issue in the issues tab.
